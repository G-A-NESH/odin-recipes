    <h2 class="recipe_description">Description</h2>
    <p>This red lentil curry is rich and hearty. It's great as a main meal rather than a side dish like the more traditional Indian <br>dhal. Don't let the ingredient list faze you â€” this is an easy dish to make. This dish is excellent served with basmati <br>rice.</p>
    <h3 class="recipe_ingredients">Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups red lentils</li>
        <li>3 cups water, or more as needed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons curry paste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon curry powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger</li>
        <li>1 (14.25 ounce) can tomato puree</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="procedure">Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash lentils in cold water until water runs clear.</li>
        <li>Put lentils in a pot with enough water to cover; bring to a boil <br>and reduce heat to medium-low. Cover and simmer, adding water as <br>needed to keep lentils covered, until tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir <br>onions in hot oil until caramelized, about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix together curry paste, curry powder, turmeric, cumin, chili powder, <br>salt, sugar, garlic, and ginger in a large bowl; stir into onions. Increase <br>heat to high and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in tomato puree and lentils; cook until warmed through.</li>
    </ol>
