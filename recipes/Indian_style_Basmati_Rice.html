    <h3 class="recipe_ingredients">Ingredients</h3>

        <li>1 ½ cups basmati rice</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 (2 inch) piece cinnamon stick</li>
        <li>2 pods green cardamom</li>

    <h3 class="procedure">Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Place rice into a bowl with enough water to cover. Set aside to soak for <br>20 minutes.</li>
        <li>In the last 10 minutes of soaking, heat oil in a large pot or saucepan over <br>medium heat. Add cinnamon stick, cardamom pods, and cloves, then <br>stir in cumin seed.</li>
        <li>Cook and stir until fragrant and toasted, about a minute. Add sliced <br>onion and stir.</li>
        <li>Sauté until the onion is tender and a rich golden brown color, about 10 <br>minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain water from rice, and stir into the pot. Cook and stir rice until <br>lightly toasted, about 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add water and salt, and bring to a boil. Cover and reduce heat to low. <br>Simmer until all the water has been absorbed, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Let stand for 5 minutes, then fluff with a fork before serving.</li>
    </ol>
